            Mohenjo-daro meaning 'Mound of the Dead Men' is an archaeological
            site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it
            was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley
            Civilisation. Mohenjo-Daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as
            the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not
            rediscovered until the 1920s. The city's original name is unknown.
            Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-Daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan
            speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma

        Mohenjo-daro is located off the right (west) bank of the lower Indus
        river in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan. It lies on a Pleistocene
        ridge in the flood plain of the Indus, around 28 kilometers from the
        town of Larkana. Mohenjo-Daro was built in the 26th century BCE.

            Taxila is a city in the Taxila Tehsil of Rawalpindi District,
            Punjab, Pakistan. It lies about 25 km northwest of
            Rawalpindi-Islamabad and is just south of Haripur District, Khyber
            Pakhtunkhwa. Old Taxila was an important city of ancient India,
            situated at the pivotal junction of the Indian subcontinent and
            Central Asia on the eastern shore of the Indus River. It was founded
            around 1000 BCE. Some ruins at Taxila date to the time of the
            Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE, followed successively by
            the Mauryan Empire, Indo-Greek,

        Indo-Scythian, and Kushan Empire periods. By some accounts, the
        University of ancient Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest
        universities in the world. Because of the extensive preservation efforts
        and upkeep, the site is a popular tourist spot, attracting up to one
        million tourists every year.

            The ancient site at Kot Diji was the forerunner of the Indus
            Civilization. The occupation of this site is attested already at
            3300 BCE. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on the
            high ground [39 ft], and the outer area. The Pakistan Department of
            Archaeology excavated at Kot Diji in 1955 and 1957. Located about 45
            km south of Khairpur in the province of Sindh, Pakistan, it is on
            the east bank of the Indus opposite Mohenjo-Daro. The site is
            situated at the foot of the Rohri Hills where a fort (Kot Diji Fort)
            was built around 1790 by the Talpur

        dynasty ruler of Upper Sindh, Mir Suhrab, who reigned from 1783 to 1830
        AD. There are obvious signs of extensive burns over the entire site,
        including both the lower habitation area and the high mound (the
        fortified town), which were also observed at other Early Harappan sites:
        Period III at Gumla, Period II at Amri, Period I at Naushero.

            Ranikot Fort is a historical Talpur fort near Sann, Jamshoro
            District, Sindh. Ranikot Fort is also known as The Great Wall of
            Sindh and is believed to be the world's largest fort, with a
            circumference of approximately 32 kilometers. The fort's ramparts
            have been compared to the Great Wall of China. Ranikot Fort is 90
            kilometers to the north of Hyderabad on the Indus highway. the
            eastern gate of the fort, known as Sann Gate. Sann is a railhead on
            the Kotri-Larkana line of the Pakistan Railway. The fort is inside
            the Kirthar National Park, the

        second largest national park in Pakistan. Archaeologists point to the
        17th century as the time of its first construction but Sindh
        archaeologists now agree that some of the present structures were
        reconstructed by the Talpur dynasty in 1812 at a cost of 1.2 million
        rupees. Radiocarbon tests were conducted at the Sann Gate on the
        charcoal embedded in the mortar of a collapsed pillar of the eastern
        gate of the fort.

            Makli Necropolis is one of the largest funerary sites in the world,
            spread over an area of 10 kilometres near the city of Thatta, in the
            Pakistani province of Sindh. The site houses approximately 500,000
            to 1 million tombs built over the course of a 400-year period. It
            lies approximately 98 km east of Karachi, near the apex of the Indus
            River Delta in southeastern Sindh. The southernmost point of the
            site is approximately 5 miles north of the ruins of the medieval
            Kallankot Fort.

        The site, and nearby hills, are said to derive their name from a legend
        in which a Hajj pilgrim stopped at the site and erupted into spiritual
        ecstasy, declaring the site to be Makkah for him. The Sufi saint Sheikh
        Hamad Jamali is then said to have named the site "Makli", or "Little
        Makkah", after hearing the story of the pilgrim.
