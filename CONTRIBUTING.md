It is an initiative undertaken by CyberBlock Community for students/young hackers who are absolute beginneers in programming and want to learn it. This repository will contain all the possible resources in terms of code as well as illustrations for the code so that any newcomer can grasp the topic.

# How to contribute

2. You can contribute in terms of improving the Documentation
## Following the procedure, you can make your contribution with ease.
### Step 0

name of branch is same as you created in step 3

e.g `git push origin mybranch`

### step 7 Submit your changes for review
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, it's now time to create pull request, you will go to the repository click on compare and pull request and submit the pull request.

Soon, we will be merging all your pull requests to the main branch of project and you will also get a notification once your pull request is merged with existing code base. After that you will be able to see your details in contributor section on the page below.
